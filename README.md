# Chingu Collaborate

This project aims to streamline and address some of the main issues associated with the primary offering of Chingu, known as Voyages. 

Firstly, with self-taught developers emerging daily, we wanted to create a platform where Chingus don't have to wait for the next available voyage that may sometimes be months away. 

Secondly, while Chingus may initially be able to commit to a Voyage there may be commitments along the way that lead them to abandoning Voyages before completion. Unfortunately, this can directly impact other Chingus and their experience with Voyages too. For example, teams can quickly go from having 5 members assigned to their voyage, to 2 members. The main problem here is that with 2 members in a voyage, Chingus aren't able to develop their collaborative learning skills that they intended to develop through their Voyage.

For these reasons, we decided to create a platform to help Chingus. Using Chingu Collaborate, Chingus will be able to collborate with other decicated Chingus in the event they miss the deadline to join a Voyage or the next Voyage is months away. Additionally, Voyage teams can leverage Chingu Collaborate to gain help with their Voyages.
